  <h3>&#128451; Data Preprocessing</h3>
  <center><img src="/static/img/datacleaning.png" width=800px height=300px/></center>
  <h4><b>  Data Cleaning: </b> For the data cleaning process, first, I dropped the unsed columns, which are "comments" and "timestamp". 
  Then I examine data in each column, and look for missing or unformatted data.
  There are some data in the Age columns which are obviously wrong information. So I deleted the rows which are lesser than 18-year-old or larger than 99-year-old.
  The gender data are inputted in different format. I classify the answers into male or female, and deleted the rows which are unidentifiable.
  Third, there are only missing data in two columns: work_interfere and self_employed. There are 1.45% of missing data in the column "self_employed", and 21% of missing data in the column "work_interfere".
  Because there are relatively small amount of missing data in "self_employed", so I classify the NaN data into No.
  I think the 21% missing data is because the people who don't have mental problems didn't answer this question. So I classify the missing data into a new category called "No mental problems".
  Finally, I classify the country data into their continents.
