  <div class="row">
    <div class="column">Mental health is an important aspect of overall health and well-being, 
      and it is particularly important in the workplace because it can affect an individual's 
      performance and their ability to interact with colleagues.</br></br>
      There are several ways that employers can support the mental health of their employees, including:</br></br>
      1. Providing access to mental health resources.</br></br>
      2. Promote a culture of openness and support, where employees feel comfortable seeking help and discussing their mental health concerns.</br></br>
      3. Offering training and education programs to increase awareness of mental health issues and how to support employees who may be struggling.</br></br>
      4.	Providing resources and support for employees to manage stress and improve work-life balance.</br></br>
      5.	Implementing policies and practices that promote a healthy work environment, such as providing regular breaks and promoting physical activity.</br></br>

  <h4>Company policies can have a significant impact on an individual's attitudes towards mental health. 
    If a company has a positive attitude towards mental health and encourages employees to prioritize their mental wellbeing, 
    employees who are facing mental health problems may be more willing to seek treatments.</h4>
  <h4>The data provided in this dataset can help us understand which personal or company factors will affect employees' attitudes toward seeking treatments.</h4>
  <h4>By understanding this information, companies can allocate their resources in the right place, and promotes employees' wellbeing at the same time.</h4>
